## Roadmap

- [ ] Step 1: Make the most basic possible game and RL agent to traverse a basic maze
  - [x] Make basic maze game
  - [ ] Connect a basic RL agent
- [ ] Step 2: Make a slightly more complicated game + agent and train it
- [ ] Step 3: Make the game a framework for training agents, with the focus on making it a framework where someone can clone the project and start writing an RL agent for the game in under 5 minutes

## Development

We suggest that you use `uv` for this project

#### Install Quick Start

TODO

## Thoughts & Insights

- We want to randomize the map so the agent doesn't just memorize the map
